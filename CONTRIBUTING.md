## Adding new features

This section includes advice on how to build new features for the project & what kind of process it includes. 

* This is how we like people to add new features:
	- create a new `feature/123-feature-name` branch where the number corresponds to an issue (where relevant)
	- push your completed branch to `origin`
* Here are some specifics on the coding style we prefer:  
	- 2 spaces, not tabbed
	- if in doubt, follow the Github style guides
* This is how you send your pull request:
	- submit a pull request from your `feature` branch into the `develop` branch
* You should include the following tests:
	- any database level features
	- any exteral service aggregators

Donâ€™t get discouraged! We estimate that the response time from the
maintainers is around: **48 hours**
